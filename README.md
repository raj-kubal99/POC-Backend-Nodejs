# Task 2 answer

Steps I'll take:
1. I'll check for the what excatly the issue is from the client end and then I'll check on my end
2. Will test locally or dev environment if i'm facing the same issue or is it client specific
3. If client specific, will ask for logs files or any debugging endpoint which they can share or I can access of their to find
4. Once information is gathered, ill check if previously similar issue has occured or same feature has caused trouble
5. Reply to client asking to provide some time based on investigation to fix it ASAP
6. Find the cause, fix it, test if its affecting any other functionality (Incase no solution is found, provide debugging fix to undersatnd the case better)
7. Provide the client with the fix and necessary step to fix it, or fix it from our end, under guidance, if required with call

There will be three standard mail, incase all communication is over mails
1. Addressing the issue
2. Responding back with finding in order to get more info, assure the client and get some time incase of high severity
3. Mail sharing the fix, further mails to enquire about the same

Mail:
To : <company endpoint>
